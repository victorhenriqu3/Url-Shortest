# ðŸ”— Url-Shortest

URL shortening service using Node

<br>

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

Implement a URL shortening service using Node and MySQL.

<br>

## ðŸ’¼ Brief

ShortLink is a URL shortening service where you enter a URL such as https://codesubmit.io/library/react and it returns a short URL such as http://short.est/GeAi9K.

<br>

## ðŸ“Œ Tasks

- [x] Two endpoints are required:

  - [x] /encode - Encodes a URL to a shortened URL

  - [x] /decode - Decodes a shortened URL to its original URL

  - [x] Both endpoints should return JSON

<br>

- [x] Persist the URLs to a database of your choice.

- [x] Provide detailed instructions on how to run your assignment in a separate markdown file (e.g. README.md).

### ðŸ“¦ Bonus

- [x] Provide API tests for both endpoints

<br>
